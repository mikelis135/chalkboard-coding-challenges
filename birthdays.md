# Birthdays app challenge

The aim is to create a small web app that allows you to keep track of birthdays.

When you open the app, you'll be able to see whose birthdays are today, or coming up in the next 2 weeks. It will also tell you how old they are (or will be).

Important: Make sure you also view our [coding challenge guidelines](README.md).

## Main features

- A single UI page that shows you today's birthdays, upcoming birthdays (next 2 weeks), and a list view of all the people whose birthdays you're keeping track of.
- For today's birthdays and upcoming, show how old that person is (or will be).
- The list should show the person's name and date of birth.
- The ability to add a new birthday to the list, requiring the person's name and date of birth (add some validation).

## The technical requirements

- The UI should be a web client or mobile app. The person setting the challenge will specify the expected language/runtime.
- You should build a simple API to store the data. There's no need to persist the data or use any kind of database.
- Use the data below to initialise the app.
- There should be tests for both the API and the client, use whatever testing frameworks/libraries you prefer.
- You don't need to provide thorough test coverage, but cover the basics and show what your approach would be.

## Example data

```
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "birthday": "1981-08-02"
  },
  {
    "name": "Katie Smith",
    "birthday": "1973-05-20"
  },
  {
    "name": "Anna Jackson",
    "birthday": "1993-10-15"
  }
]
```
