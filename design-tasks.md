# Design tasks

A selection of product design focused tasks that allow candidates to demonstrate their skills outside of coding.

Important: Make sure you also view our [coding challenge guidelines](README.md).

## Ecommerce case study

Which is the worst ecommerce implementation you've used in recent years? Write up the reasons it's so bad. If possible, take some screenshots and mark them up to show the problems.

Now think about the best ecommerce sites. What is it they do so well? Are there any more improvements they could make? Again, use screenshots if possible.

## Booking flow concept

Take any service that you're familiar with, and ideally one that you have used/bought before. It should be something that needs to be booked and paid for.

Design a process for booking and paying for that service. Think about how the flow can be tailored to the unique attributes of the service you chose. The flow should be designed for use on a mobile phone.

Explain the type of customer that may book the service, the particular problems the flow needs to deal with, any challenges that need to be overcome, and any edge cases and how they would be handled.

## Improve a UI design

Select any mobile or web app that you use regularly. It's important that you have a good understanding of what it does and what problems it solves for you. Please note that down.

Now take one main screen within the app. This should be a dashboard or homepage, or a major function within the app. Create a new UI design. Add some notes to the design to explain how it should function.

Explain what the problems are with the current design and how the new design improves on it.
