# Birthdays app challenge

The aim is to create a small web app that allows you to keep track of birthdays.

When you open the app, you'll be able to see whose birthdays are today, or coming up in the next 2 weeks. It will also tell you how old they are (or will be).

Important: Make sure you also view our [coding challenge guidelines](README.md).

## Main features

- A single UI page that shows you today's birthdays, upcoming birthdays (next 2 weeks), and a list view of all the people whose birthdays you're keeping track of.
- For today's birthdays and upcoming, show how old that person is (or will be).
- The list should show the person's name and date of birth.
- The ability to add a new birthday to the list, requiring the person's name and date of birth (add some validation).
- It should also be possible to delete birthdays from the app.

## The technical requirements

- The UI should be a web client or mobile app. The person setting the challenge will specify the expected language/runtime.
- We will provide an API for you to build against, see below.
- It's fine to bring in a UI components library or to use native components. We are looking for good usability, visual hierarchy, focus, and layout, but not a polished design.
- There should be tests for the client, use whatever testing frameworks/libraries you prefer.
- You don't need to provide thorough test coverage, but cover the basics and show what your approach would be.

## API

You'll be provided a working API to use as a backend for the app. This allows for birthdays to be listed, created, and deleted.

The data on this API is reset daily.

## Time limit

Please spend no more than 3 hours on this challenge.
