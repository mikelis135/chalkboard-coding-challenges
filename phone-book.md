# Phone book app challenge

The aim is to create a small client side web app that allows you to view a list of people and their contact details.

Important: Make sure you also view our [coding challenge guidelines](README.md).

## Main features

- A single UI page that shows a list of people.
- You should be able to click into each person to see their contact details.
- The contact details should include email address and phone number.

## The technical requirements

- The UI should be a web client or mobile app. The person setting the challenge will specify the expected language/runtime.
- For this challenge, there is no need to create any server side API.
- Use the data below to initialise the app.
- Use any frameworks you prefer.
- There should be tests included for the front end, use whatever testing frameworks/libraries you prefer.

## Example data

```
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "+44 (0)1282 123456",
